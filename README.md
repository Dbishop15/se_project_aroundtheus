**Intro**

This project called "Around The U.S.". A gallery of various landmarks throughout the United States. The project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. Also creating page design of adding and removing photos button, and like photos of other users.

Working with designs in a graphics editor called Figma. Most of the images we need can be exported directly from Figma. Working with a Figma design that provides layouts for mobile (320px) and desktop (1280px).

Create responsive websites using Grid Layout

Use media queries to set parameters for different screen sizes. The webpage will be responsive, i.e., the width of the content area will change depending on the width of the browser window, and there won’t be any horizontal scrolling.

**Figma**

You’ll be working with a Figma design that provides layouts for mobile (320px) and desktop (1280px).

**Images**

The way the project works is by exporting images directly from Figma and optimizing them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so the project loads faster.

**Font**

All fonts used in this project are from the Inter family, which you can download from their website, https://rsms.me/inter/.

**Images here is an example of finished webpage on dektop and mobile**

<img
  src="/images/screen320px.png"
  alt="finshed webpage on desktop and mobile.png"
  style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 150px">
<img
  src="/images/finshed webpage on desktop and mobile.png"
  alt="finshed webpage on desktop and mobile.png"
  style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 150px">

**Javascript and array**

Creating a .js file for index.html page. Cretat an array and store it in the variable. Inserting data into HTML using JavaScript. Adding a script file to project and cretating an array with the card data.

**Modal Box**

Creating a modal box with HTML and CSS. Write the markup and styles for the "Edit profile" modal box for both desktop and mobile. It has two fields, titled "Name" and "About me", and buttons to submit and close the form.

**The DOM**
Implementing the opening and closing of the modal box by adding functions to the project by using the DOM.

**Adding some final functionality to the modal box**

Once the form has been opened, the "Name" and "About me" fields be filled in with the values. Once the user enters new information and clicks on the "Save" button, the page has to update to reflect the changes made, with the modal closing simultaneously. Also making the cards render from the array.
