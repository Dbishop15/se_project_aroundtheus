**Intro**

This project called "Around The U.S.". A gallery of various landmarks throughout the United States. The project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. Also creating page design of adding and removing photos button, and like photos of other users.

Working with designs in a graphics editor called Figma. Most of the images we need can be exported directly from Figma. Working with a Figma design that provides layouts for mobile (320px) and desktop (1280px).

Create responsive websites using Grid Layout

Use media queries to set parameters for different screen sizes. The webpage will be responsive, i.e., the width of the content area will change depending on the width of the browser window, and there won’t be any horizontal scrolling.

**Figma**

You’ll be working with a Figma design that provides layouts for mobile (320px) and desktop (1280px).
